Pratik Mayekar 111503055

This is a version of the popular Dinosaur runner game of Google Chrome.

The game begins with a space bar and the dinosaur runs in a 2D world and obstacles approach.
The player has to dodge the obstacles by jumping across the obstacles.

As the level advances, the speed and the types of obstacles increases.
The speed increases after every 1000 points on the score.

The game also stores the highscore of a gameplay. Just like how the original Chrome game does.
